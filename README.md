# CS405 - Computer Graphics

This repository contains coursework and projects for **CS405: Computer Graphics**, offered by the Computer Science and Engineering program at **SabancÄ± University**.

## Course Description

CS405 introduces the principles and techniques of computer graphics. It covers the mathematical foundations of 2D and 3D graphics, rendering pipelines, and real-time visualization using OpenGL/WebGL frameworks. The course blends theoretical understanding with hands-on coding assignments.

### Topics Covered
- Graphics pipeline and coordinate systems
- 2D and 3D geometric transformations
- Viewing and camera models (e.g., lookAt, perspective projection)
- Lighting models (ambient, diffuse, specular)
- Shading techniques (Phong shading)
- Scene graph and hierarchical modeling
- Texturing and material properties
- Real-time rendering using shaders (GLSL)

## Tools and Technologies
- **OpenGL / WebGL**
- **GLSL** (OpenGL Shading Language)
- **JavaScript** (for WebGL projects)
- **C++** (in some assignments)
- **HTML/CSS** (for canvas-based rendering in web projects)
